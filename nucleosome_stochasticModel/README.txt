The folder name indicates that the code related to the indicated figure is included in the folder.
Instructions for using the codes are provided in the codes.

In Figure2_experimental_data, 
- ikbamut_10ngTNF.mat and tnf_10ng.mat are NFkB trajectories (Adelaja, Taylor et al, 2021)
- plot_example_traces.R produces the plots of this data for Fig 2A. 
- ATAC_inputs folder contains input files for the script analysis_2.R for Figs2B and 2C. 

In Figure5_experimental_data, 
-ISRE_sym.mat is the symmetrized full eviction probability with the ISRE signal for each relative distance to dyad (from -100 base pairs to 0 base pairs)
-NFkB_sym.mat is the symmetrized full eviction probability with the NFkB signal for each relative distance to dyad (from -100 base pairs to 0 base pairs)
-parameter_isre.mat is the fitted parameter for the ISRE case that used for Figure 5C (h, b_1/a_1, BF, 1/(2\sigma^2), a_1)
-parameter_nfkb.mat is the fitted parameter for the NFkB case that used for Figure 5B (h, b_1/a_1, BF, 1/(2\sigma^2), a_1)
